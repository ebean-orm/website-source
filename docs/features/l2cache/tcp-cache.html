  <h3>Note: (as per 7.5.1)</h3>
  <p>
    As per version 7.5.1 the clustering support has been refactored and pulled into a separate module.
    By default ebean-cluster is included as a dependency and uses TCP sockets for cluster communication.
  </p>

  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    When Ebean servers are running in a cluster then it is the job of the clustering support to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notify L2 cache invalidation events</li>
    <li>Notify BeanPersistListeners (of remote insert/update/delete events)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When a transaction commits the events that will result in cache invalidation or have registered
    BeanPersistListeners are collected into a <code>RemoteTransactionEvent</code> and this event
    is broadcast to all the members in the cluster. Each member then processes the event invalidating
    parts of the local L2 cache and invoking listeners as necessary.
  </p>

  <h2 id="container">Container</h2>
  <p>
    Internally Ebean has a <code>container</code> whose job is to create EbeanServer instances and to manage
    cluster communication (like TCP sockets). The container has access to all the EbeanServer instances it
    creates and can access them by name. The EbeanServer name is included in the cluster messages and is
    used to identify which EbeanServer needs to process any given cluster message.
  </p>

  <h2 id="l2cache-invalidation">L2 cache invalidation</h2>
  <p>
    For details on L2 cache invalidation refer to <a href="/docs/features/l2cache#table-iud-invalidation">Table IUD</a> invalidation
    and <a href="/docs/features/l2cache#bean-iud-invalidation">Bean IUD</a> invalidation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a bean type is not using L2 bean cache or L2 query cache and that bean type also does not have a
    <code>BeanPersistListener</code> registered then bean persist events for that type
    (Bean insert, update and delete) are not sent across the cluster (as there is no L2 cache invalidation required).
  </p>

  <h2 id="cluster-message">Cluster message</h2>
  <p>
    The message send around the cluster is a <code>RemoteTransactionEvent</code> which contains information for
    Table IUD bulk changes and Bean IUD events.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each message contains the
  </p>

  <h4>EbeanServer name</h4>
  <p>
    The name of the EbeanServer the message relates to.
  </p>

  <h4>Table IUD details</h4>
  <p>
    For bulk table insert, update or delete events the message contains the table name and boolean flags for insert,
    update and delete.
  </p>

  <h4>Bean IUD details</h4>
  <p>
    For bean insert, update or delete events the message contains the bean type (class name) and a list of id values
    for inserted, updated and deleted beans.
  </p>


  <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    By default clustering support is included via a dependency on <code>ebean-cluster</code> so we just
    need to configure it. The example properties below show the configuration for a 3 node cluster.
  </p>
  ```properties
  ebean.cluster.active=true

  ## the host:port for this node
  ebean.cluster.localHostPort=127.0.0.1:9942

  ## all the members of the cluster
  ebean.cluster.members=127.0.0.1:9942,127.0.0.1:9943,127.0.0.1:9944
  ```
  <p>
    Each member of the cluster should configure their unique <code>localHostPort</code> value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cluster configuration is per <code>container</code> and not per <code>EbeanServer</code> instance.
    The EbeanServer name is part of the message sent around the cluster and is used to get the correct
    EbeanServer instance to process each message.
  </p>

  <h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
  <p>
    At <code>INFO</code> level logging on <code>io.ebean.Cluster</code> messages are output
    when clustering starts, stops and members leave or join.
  </p>
  <h5>Startup configuration</h5>
  ```text
  INFO  io.ebean.Cluster - Clustering using local[127.0.0.1:9943] members[[127.0.0.1:9942, 127.0.0.1:9943]]
  ```
  ```text
  INFO  io.ebean.Cluster - Register as online with member [localhost:9942]
  ```
  <h5>Member joining/leaving</h5>
  ```text
  INFO  io.ebean.Cluster - Cluster member [localhost:9943] online[true]
  ```

  <p>
    At <code>DEBUG</code> level messages are logged for sending and receiving events.
  </p>
  <h5>Sent message</h5>
  ```text
  DEBUG io.ebean.Cluster - sending: [org.example.domain.Customer updateIds:[4]]
  ```
  <h5>Received message</h5>
  ```text
  DEBUG io.ebean.Cluster - processing [org.example.domain.Customer updateIds:[4]]
  ```

  <h2 id="beanPersistListener">BeanPersistListener</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="/apidoc/12/io/ebean/event/AbstractBeanPersistListener.html">BeanPersistListener</a> listens for committed bean events.
  </p>
  <p>
    These listen events occur after a successful commit. They also occur in a background thread rather than the thread
    used to perform the actual insert update or delete. In this way there is a delay between the commit and when the listener is notified of the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a cluster these events are broadcast to support the <code>remoteInsert()</code>, <code>remoteUpdate()</code>
    and <code>remoteDelete()</code> methods.
  </p>

  <h2 id="external-modification">External modification</h2>
  <p>
    You use <code>ebeanServer.externalModification()</code> to notify Ebean that beans have been committed
    externally using raw JDBC, some other framework like Spring JDBC or some other process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This translates directly into a <code>Table IUD</code> message that is sent around the cluster to invalidate
    L2 cache as appropriate.
