<h2 id="pair">Relationship Pair</h2>
<p>
  We can think of a <code>@OneToOne</code>/<code>@OneToOne</code> relationship pair as
  the same as a <code>@OneToMany</code>/<code>@ManyToOne</code> relationship pair but with the
  addition that the "many" side has a cardinality of "at most 1".
</p>
<p>
  From a Relational database perspective the @OneToOne relationship pair is
  like the @OneToMany/@ManyToOne pair but with the <code>addition of a unique
  constraint</code> which effectively limits the cardinality of the "many" side to be "at most 1".
</p>
<p>
  From the perspective of Ebean internals. The @OneToOne(mappedBy=) acts much
  like the @OneToMany(mappedBy=) <em>[the "many" side]</em> and the other @OneToOne acts
  like the @ManyToOne <em>[the "one" side]</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="manySide">@OneToOne "many" side</h2>
<p>
  The "many" side @OneToOne has the <code>mappedBy</code> attribute (like @OneToMany).
</p>
```java
@Entity
public class Wheel ...

  // has "mappedBy" (like @OneToMany)
  // ... so we can think of this as the "many" side
  // ... with cardinality limited to "at most 1"
  @OneToOne(mappedBy = "wheel")
  Tire tire;
  ...
```

<h2 id="oneSide">@OneToOne "one" side</h2>
<p>
  The "one" side @OneToOne has no <code>mappedBy</code> attribute.
  This side acts almost exactly like @ManyToOne.
</p>
<p>
  This side maps to the foreign key column. If the foreign key column does not match the
  naming convention we can specify a <code>@JoinColumn</code>.
</p>
```java
@Entity
public class Tire ...

  // no mappedBy (like @OneToMany)
  // ... so the "one" side of the relationship
  // ... means it maps to the foreign key
  // ... use @JoinColumn if needed
  @OneToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "wheel")
  Wheel wheel;
```
