<h2>@History</h2>
<p>
  Mapping added to an entity to indicate that it should have History support. This means that all
  changes to the underlying table are kept and maintained in history tables or database native SQL2011 history.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean will take care of the DDL generation required to support history as well as provide query extensions
  to find history versions and view historic data.
