<h3>findIterate (Execute a query iterating over the results)</h3>

<p>
Execute the query iterating over the results. This is good for processing large results where we want to avoid holding all the beans/results in memory but instead iterator through them.
</p>
 <p>
 Note that <code>findIterate</code> (and <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a>) uses a "per graph"
 persistence context scope and adjusts <code>jdbc</code> fetch buffer size for large
 queries. As such it is better to use <a href='findList'>findList</a> for small queries.
 </p>
 <p>
 Remember that with <a href='/apidoc/current/io/ebean/QueryIterator.html'>QueryIterator</a> you must call <code>close()</code>
 when you have finished iterating the results (typically in a finally block).
 </p>
 <p>
 <a href='findEach'>findEach()</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile()</a> are preferred to <code>findIterate</code> as they ensure
 the <code>jdbc</code> statement and <code>resultSet</code> are closed at the end of the iteration.
 </p>
 <p>
 This query will execute against the <code>EbeanServer</code> that was used to create it.
 </p>

<h3>Closing Resources</h3>

<b>As stated before, we must ensure the iterator is closed</b> as it holds <code>JDBC</code> resources.

We should use <code>try-with-resources</code> or a <code>try-finally</code> block to make sure that the <a href='/apidoc/11/io/ebean/QueryIterator.html'>QueryIterator</a> is closed regardless of exceptions thrown during processing.

Note that <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a> ensure all resources are closed regardless and for this reason they are recommended over <code>findIterate</code>.

There are some use cases where <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a> don't naturally fit and that is when we would look to use <code>findIterate</code>.

<h3> Example Code </h3>

Example with <code>try-finally</code>
 ```java

  Query<Customer> query =
    ebeanServer.find(Customer.class)
     .where().eq("status", Status.NEW)
     .order().asc("id");

  QueryIterator<Customer> it = query.findIterate();
  try {
    while (it.hasNext()) {
      Customer customer = it.next();
      // do something with customer ...
    }
  } finally {
    // close the underlying resources
    it.close();
  }

 ```

Example with <code>try-with-resources</code>
 ```java
   try (QueryIterator<Customer> it = query.findIterate()) {
         while (it.hasNext()) {
           Customer customer = it.next();
           customer.getName();
           count.incrementAndGet();
         }
   }
```
