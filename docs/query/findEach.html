<h2>findEach (process large queries, one bean at a time)</h2>

<p>
This method is appropriate to process very large query results as the
beans are consumed one at a time and do not need to be held in memory
  (unlike <a href="/docs/query/findList">findList</a> <a href='/docs/query/findSet'>findSet</a> etc)
</p>
<p>
  Note that <code>findEach</code> (and <a href="/docs/query/findEachWhile">findEachWhile</a> and <a href="/docs/query/findIterate">findIterate</a>) uses a "per graph"
persistence context scope and adjusts jdbc fetch buffer size for large
queries. As such it is better to use findList for small queries.
</p>
<p>
Note that internally Ebean can inform the JDBC driver that it is expecting larger
resultSet and specifically for <code>MySQL</code> this hint is required to stop it's JDBC driver
from buffering the entire resultSet. As such, for smaller resultSets <a href="/docs/query/findList">findList()</a> is
generally preferable.
</p>
<p>
  Compared with <a href="/docs/query/findEachWhile">findEachWhile</a> this will always process all the beans where as
  <a href="/docs/query/findEachWhile">findEachWhile</a> provides a way to stop processing the query result early before
all the beans have been read.
</p>
<p>
  This method is functionally equivalent to <a href="/docs/query/findIterate">findIterate()</a> but instead of using an
  iterator uses the <code>Consumer<T></code> interface which is better suited to use with Java8 closures.
</p>


 ```java
  ebeanServer.find(Customer.class)
     .where().eq("status", Status.NEW)
     .order().asc("id")
     .findEach((Customer customer) -> {

       // do something with customer
       System.out.println("-- visit " + customer);
     });
 ```
