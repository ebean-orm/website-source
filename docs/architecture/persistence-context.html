  <h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
  <p>Although Ebean doesn't have a JPA Entity Manager, it does have a persistence context. Any ORM worth using needs a persistence context in order
    to build consistent object graphs.</p>

  <h4>JPA v1.0 specification - section 5.1</h4>
  <blockquote>"A persistence context is a set of managed entity instances in which for any persistent entity identity
    there is a unique entity instance. Within the persistence context, the entity instances and their
    lifecycle are managed by the entity manager."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ebean has a persistence context to ensure <code>unique entity instance.</code>
    but has a different approach to the lifecycle management
    compared with JPA. Ebean has no entity manager and no persist/merge/flush lifecycle
    methods and the persistence context is not actually involved in persisting.</p>


  <h2 id="unique-instances">Unique Entity Instances</h2>

  <p>Ebean uses the persistence context for queries and lazy loading (when it is building object
    graphs). This is to ensure that <code>consistent object graphs</code> are constructed
    (1 unique instance per identity).</p>
  <blockquote>
    Ensuring unique instances equates to building a consistent object graph
  </blockquote>

  <p>For example, in fetching a list of orders and their customers … the persistence context
    ensures that you only get 1 customer instance for it's given id (e.g. you are NOT allowed to
    have 2 or more instances of "customer id=7".</p>

  <p> The "persistence context" ensures the user/application code works with unique entity instances.</p>

  <p>For example, if you didn't have a persistence context and did allow 2 or more instances of
    "customer 7" … and modified one instance but not the other … things get very ugly.</p>

  <h2 id="persisting">Persisting</h2>

  <p>Ebean has a different approach to lifecycle management. With
    Ebean each bean has it's own dirty checking (detects when it has been modified and
    holds it's old/original values for optimistic concurrency checking).
  </p>

  <p>
    This means that Ebean does not need or use the persistence context when persisting beans.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Ebean's persistence context is not involved in persisting.
  </blockquote>

  <p>With JPA implementations the dirty checking is performed by the entity manager.
    The entity manager generally holds the old/original values for optimistic concurrency
    checking and the beans need to be 'attached' to an entity manager to be 'flushed' (as an
    insert/update/delete). [Note: JDO based JPA implementations do this a bit differently].
  </p>

  <p>
    Pro's for Ebean's approach:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No need to manage Entity Manager's</li>
    <li>save/delete simpler that attached/detached beans with persist/merge/flush etc</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Con's for Ebean's approach:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ebean makes an assumption that scalar types are immutable. Most scalar types (String, Integer, Double, Float,
      BigDecimal etc) are immutable, but some like <code>java.util.Date</code> are not. If you mutate a mutable scalar like <code>java.util.Date</code>,
      Ebean will NOT detect the change – instead you have to set a different <code>java.util.Date</code>
      instance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="scopes">Scopes</h2>

  <p>
    Ebean has 3 scopes for the the persistence context - <code>Transaction scope</code>, <code>Query scope</code>
    and <code>Per Object Graph scope</code>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="transaction-scope">Transaction scope</h2>

  <p>With Ebean, the persistence context is transaction scoped by default. When you begin
    a new transaction (implicitly or explicitly) Ebean will start a new persistence context.</p>

  <p>The persistence context lives beyond the end of a transaction. This enables any lazy
    loading done after the transaction ends to use the same persistence context that the instance
    was created with.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means, a persistence context
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Starts when a transaction starts</li>
    <li>Is used during the transactions scope to build all object graphs (queries)</li>
    <li>Lives beyond the end of a transaction so that all lazy loading occurring on that object graph also uses the same
      persistence context
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Transaction scoped persistence context as a "first level cache"</h3>

  <p>The persistence context is sometimes described as the "first level cache" or L1 cache. I have also seen
    it described as the "transactional cache" in that it is most frequently scoped to a transaction.</p>

  <pre content="java">
  // a new persistence context started with the transaction
  Ebean.beginTransaction();
  try {
    // find "order 72" results in that instance being put
    // into the persistence context
    Order order = Ebean.find(Order.class, 72);

    // finds an existing "order 72" in the persistence context
    // ... so just returns that instance
    Order o2 = Ebean.find(Order.class, 72);
    Order o3 = Ebean.getReference(Order.class, 72);

    // all the same instance
    Assert.assertTrue(order == o2);
    Assert.assertTrue(order == o3);
  } finally {
    Ebean.endTransaction();
  }
  </pre>
  <p>
    The code above shows that there is only 1 instance of "Order 72". As we try to fetch it
    again, (during the scope of a single persistence context) we end up getting back the same
    instance.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, typically we don't write code that fetches the same Order multiple times in a
    single transaction. The code above is not something we would typically write.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more realistic example would be when the persistence context is used:
  </p>
  <pre content="java">
    // a new persistence context started with the transaction
    Ebean.beginTransaction();

    try {
      // find "customer 1" results in this instance being
      // put into the persistence context
      Customer customer = Ebean.find(Customer.class, 1);

      // for this example … "customer 1" placed "order 72"
      // when "order 72" is fetched/built it has a foreign
      // key value customer_id = 1...
      // As customer 1 is already in the persistence context
      // this same instance of customer 1 is used
      Order order = Ebean.find(Order.class, 72);
      Customer customerB = order.getCustomer();

      // they are the same instance
      Assert.assertTrue(customer == customerB);
    } finally {
      Ebean.endTransaction();
    }
  </pre>


  <p>
    From these examples you should see that the persistence context acts as a
    cache to some degree. It can sometimes reduce the number of database queries required
    when you get object graphs and navigate them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary function of the persistence context is to ensure unique instances
    for a given identity (so that the object graphs are constructed in a consistent manner). That it sometimes looks/acts like a cache is a side effect.
  </p>


  <h2 id="query-scope">Query Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of the query scope is to effectively bypass a transaction scoped persistence context
    (L1 cache) in order to read fresh data from the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general scenario is that you are in the middle of a transaction and you want to make sure that
    a particular query hits the database to get fresh data. In doing so, we want to avoid using the
    current transaction-scoped persistence context.
  </p>
  <pre content="java">

  // transaction with a persistence context
  Transaction transaction = ...

  // Fetch customer 42 hitting the database
  // ... ignoring the transaction persistence context
  Customer customer = Ebean.find(Customer.class)
        .setId(42)
        // ignore transaction persistence context
        .setPersistenceContextScope(QUERY)
        .findOne();

  </pre>

  <h2 id="object-scope">Object graph scope - large queries</h2>
  <p>
    When you use a <code>findEach()</code>, <code>findStream()</code> or <code>findIterate()</code>
    streaming type query then Ebean uses a special scope for the persistence context.
    These queries are expected to iterate through arbitrarily large query requests, so we don't want to hold all the object graphs in memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these streaming queries, Ebean creates a new <code>PersistenceContext</code> when iteration
    occurs and the scope effectively becomes per object graph.
  </p>
