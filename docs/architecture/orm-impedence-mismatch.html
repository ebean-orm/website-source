<h2 id="overview">ORM for OLTP only</h2>
<p>
  If you try to look at ORM from the viewpoint of trying to cover the entire feature set
  of Relational Databases then yes there is absolutely a large mismatch.
</p>
<p>
  Certainly for Ebean ORM and I'd suggest in general ORM is a poor abstraction for a large
  feature set of Relational Databases and specifically ORM is not well placed to be a
  good abstraction for <code>Reporting</code> and <code>Data Warehouse</code> features.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean ORM is orientated towards OLTP with reasonably normalised schemas and well known
  relationships but Relational Databases can do much more than this.
</p>

<h2>Impedance details</h2>
<p>
  Lets continue to look into the ORM impedance details with the view that we are restricting
  ourselves to OLTP Databases.
</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Object vs Relational relationships</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Schema ownership conflict</h3>
<p>
  Ted makes the point that there can be a conflict if DBA's control the database schema
  (and thus it is not under control of the development team). This seems like an
  organisation structure point as opposed to some fundamental issue with ORM.
</p>
<p>
  Ted's point about a schema being "frozen" by denormalisation and reporting requirements
  seems a stretch. Denormalisation on an OLTP DB design should be additive and non-breaking
  and a good DB design should be well placed to allow it to be extended by adding columns and tables etc.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately if the schema is designed well and then there should no major mapping issue.
</p>

<h3>Discriminator column and Reporting</h3>
<p>
  I think Ted makes a reasonable point about inheritance and reporting though. His point there
  is that typical SQL reporting tools are not often not well placed to handle "discriminator column"
  and inheritance in general.
</p>
<p>
  For me the mitigation of this issue is to provide views as needed to flatten inheritance schemas for
  reporting tools.
</p>

<h3>Dual schema problem</h3>
<h4>DB Migration</h4>
<p>
  Ted's first point is that there is now effectively an Object model (entity beans) and DB model (tables)
  and there is a issue that these need to be kept in sync.
</p>
<p>
  This issue is reasonably addressed by <code>DB Migration</code> where Ebean generates a <code>DIFF</code>
  to the DB schema and either <code>FlywayDB</code> or Ebean's own DB Migration runner applies that as an
  application task.
</p>
<h4>DB Refactoring</h4>
<p>
  Ted's second point is that the DB is typically a shared resource and that means you can't just refactor
  the DB design without breaking other applications.
</p>
<p>
  The argument against that is that <code>IF</code> the DB design got to <code>4NF</code> then the only
  changes to it should be non breaking changes. That is, <code>Normalization</code> has the properties that
  it can be proven correct and DB multiple designers will get to the same design at 4NF by following the
  normalisation rules.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike programming DB design via normalisation is somewhat strict and deterministic.
</p>


<h4>Identity</h4>
<p>
  I completely disagree with Ted's point regarding identity and that is based on the fact that an ORM
  is fundamentally presenting the application with a <code>SNAPSHOT</code> view of part of the database.
</p>
<p>
  That is, what we are doing with ORM is <code>exactly the same as what we were doing with client/server</code>
  tools in terms of presenting a <code>snapshot</code> of part of the database <code>at a given time</code>
  via a <code>transaction</code> at a particular <code>isolation level</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The issues with identity (Id value to Primary key) and concurrency (optimistic locking via @Version property)
  are exactly the same as they were with client server tools of old and there is no ORM mismatch issue here with Ebean.
</p>
<p>
  However, an ORM that NEEDS to put unsaved beans that don't yet have an Identity into some "PersistenceContext"
  and relies on hashCode()/equals() has created a problem for themselves (but that isn't an ORM problem that is
  an implementation mistake).
</p>


<h4>Partial object problem</h4>
<p>
  Ebean solves this well and this IMO a massively important feature for an ORM.
</p>

<h4>N + 1</h4>
<p>
  Ebean solves this well via query language and also provides profiling and automatic
  query tuning to optimise this per use case.
