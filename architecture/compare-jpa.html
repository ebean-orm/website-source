<h2 id="sessionless">Sessionless architecture</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <@video_item "ogx6hsLl95g" "Sessionless ORM" "How Ebean is architected to be a sessionless ORM" />
    </div>
</div>
<p>
  JPA is architected such that entity beans must be <code>attached</code> to the <code>PersistenceContext</code>
  in order to be <code>persisted</code>.
</p>
<p>
  That is, JPA mandates <code>attach/detach</code> semantics. This has a number of consequences including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developers can't easily take control and persist selected objects</li>
  <li>All attached beans must be in a valid state to flush</li>
  <li>Flush implicitly flushes all dirty state (so dirty state created <em>anywhere</em> flushes implicitly)</li>
  <li>Flush can reorder statements in unexpected ways (causing deadlocks)</li>
  <li>The EntityManager scope must now be managed along with the transaction scope</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ebean architecture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No Entity manager, only manage transactions</li>
  <li>Dirty state on each entity bean</li>
  <li>Persisting (save, delete) does not require the PersistenceContext</li>
  <li>PersistenceContext attached to the Transaction</li>
  <li>Partially populated beans are always expected</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="persist-features">Persist features</h2>

<h3>JDBC batch control</h3>
<p>
  With JPA there is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No control over JDBC batch size</li>
  <li>No ability to turn off getGeneratedKeys to optimise large inserts</li>
  <li>No ability to turn off cascade behavior (to take full control)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Using JDBC batch is important so that we can get optimal performance when persisting. With Ebean
  there is a JDBC batch buffer attached to the transaction that can seamlessly batch up persistence
  calls using JDBC batch.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean provides full control over JDBC batch via the transaction, including the
  <code>batch size</code>, <code>getGeneratedKeys</code>, and <code>cascade behavior</code>.
  In contrast to JPA, it is easy to fully control and optimise batch processing with Ebean.
</p>

<h3>Transaction</h3>
<p>
  Ebean provides the ability on a transaction to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register transaction callbacks (Post commit callback etc)</li>
  <li>Set and get user defined objects</li>
  <li>Specify if L2 cache should be skipped for the transaction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Raw JDBC</h3>
<p>
  Ebean provides access to the underlying <code>java.sql.Connection</code> for performing
  raw JDBC if needed along with a <code>transaction.addModification(table, ...)</code> method to
  tell Ebean what tables were modified for L2 cache invalidation.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean also has built in <code>SqlUpdate</code> and <code>CallableSql</code> for easy SQL bulk
  statements and calling stored procedures.
</p>

<h3>Transaction Isolation level</h3>
<p>
  Ebean lets you start a transaction at a higher isolation level. JPA does not support this.
</p>

<h3>Stateless updates</h3>
<p>
  Ebean allows us to populate a bean (or object graph) and <code>update()</code> without loading
  the object object. This is useful in REST-like API's where we want to populate an entity object graph
  from JSON and perform an update.
</p>

<hr/>
<h2 id="query-features">Query features</h2>

<h3>findCount</h3>
<p>
  Ebean has built in <code>findCount</code> which takes a copy of the query and optimises it for executing
  a count (by removing fetch, ordering etc). In JPA we would use the <code>count() function</code> and can't
  use the same query to for a <code>findList</code> type query.
</p>

<h3>findPagedList</h3>
<p>
  JPA has no support for a <code>PagedList</code> query that supports finding the "total count" for the
  query as well as a page of results. (Spring Data JPA helps fill this gap somewhat).
</p>

<h3>findEach</h3>
<p>
  JPA has no support for executing large queries. Ebean has <code>findEach</code>
  for executing large queries (cursors / streaming) that takes into account the scope of the persistence context,
  JDBC driver, fetchSize, and MySql specific treatment (because MySql has specific issues to deal with).
</p>

<h3>findMap</h3>
<p>
  JPA has no equivalent to Ebean's <code>findMap</code> which returns the objects mapped by a property.
</p>

<h3>Async queries</h3>
<p>
  Ebean has built in support for executing queries in the background returning <code>Futures</code>
  with <code>findFutureList(), findFutureCount() and findFutureIds().</code>
  This provides an easy way to execute queries that can be cancelled.
</p>
<p>
  Internally findFutureCount() is used as part of <code>PagedList</code> query such that the
  total count query can be executed in parallel to the findList() query.
</p>

<h3>As of history query</h3>
<p>
  JPA has no support for SQL2011 <a href="/docs/features/history#as-of-query"><code>AS OF</code></a> queries yet.
</p>

<h3>Versions between history query</h3>
<p>
  JPA has no support for SQL2011 <a href="/docs/features/history#versions-between-query"><code>VERSIONS BETWEEN</code></a> queries yet.
</p>

<h3>Generics</h3>
<p>
  JPA missed using generics with it's initial API and hence has both <code>Query</code> and <code>TypedQuery</code>
  which is not ideal.
</p>


<h3 id="jpql">JPQL</h3>
<p>
  <code>JPQL</code> has both poor support for <code><a href="/docs/query/partialobjects">partial objects</a></code>
  and poor support for <code><a href="/docs/query/nplus1">optimising complex queries for N + 1</a></code> by defining
  what part of the object graph should be fetched.
</p>
<p>
  In it's current state <code>JPQL</code> is a poor language for optimising ORM queries. JPA 2.1 added
  in support for <code>fetch groups</code> as a query hint but there are a number of issues with this:
  being rather inelegant to use, only a query hint with relatively poor support and ultimately missing
  some important features for controlling object graph construction from mixed sources (L2, L3 and DB).
</p>
<p>
  The emphasis on annotations <code>FetchType.Eager</code> and <code>FetchType.Lazy</code>
  and limitations in JPQL has put JPA in a bad position for optimising ORM queries. It will be
  interesting if they can get to the level of control over object graph construction that Ebean supports.
</p>

<h3 id="type-safe-query">Type safe queries</h3>
<p>
  One could argue there is a bit more "ceremony" with JPA Criteria queries that make the
  query more verbose and harder to read.
</p>

<h5>Ebean "Query beans"</h5>
<pre content="java">
LocalDate today = new LocalDate();

List<|Customer> customers =
  new QCustomer()
    .birthday.equalTo(today)
    .createdAt.before(today.minusYears(2))
    .findList();
</pre>

<h5>JPA Criteria</h5>
<pre content="java">
LocalDate today = new LocalDate();

EntityManager em = ...;

CriteriaBuilder builder = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<|Customer> query = builder.createQuery(Customer.class);
Root<|Customer> root = query.from(Customer.class);

Predicate hasBirthday = builder.equal(root.get(Customer_.birthday), today);
Predicate isLongTermCustomer = builder.lessThan(root.get(Customer_.createdAt), today.minusYears(2);
query.where(builder.and(hasBirthday, isLongTermCustomer));

List<|Customer> customers = em.createQuery(query.select(root)).getResultList();
</pre>
<p>
  Java annotation processing is used by both Ebean (to generate "Query beans") and JPA
  (to generate
  <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/topical/html/metamodelgen/MetamodelGenerator.html">JPA Query Meta model classes</a>
  in order to provide type safe query construction and execution.
</p>

<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>

<h3>Constructor</h3>
<p>
  Unlike JPA Ebean does not require a default constructor.
</p>

<h3>@View</h3>
<p>
  Ebean has built in support for entities based on database views.
</p>

<h3>Entities without @Id</h3>
<p>
  Ebean does not require entities to have an @Id property. These entities are considered "read only" and
  automatically bypass the persistence context. These entities are typically used for reporting purposes.
</p>

<h3>Naming convention</h3>
<p>
  The JPA spec naming convention includes both mixed case and underscores - it is odd. Ebean's default naming
  convention of <code>UnderscoreNamingConvention</code> matches Hibernates <code>ImprovedNamingStrategy</code>
  and not the JPA spec naming convention.
</p>

<h3>Auditing & @History</h3>
<p>
  Ebean has built in support for <code>@WhenCreated</code>, <code>@WhenModified</code>, <code>@WhoCreated</code>
  , <code>@WhoModified</code> and full <a href="/docs/features/history">SQL2011 @History support</a>.
</p>

<h3>JSON in DB</h3>
<p>
  Ebean includes mapping support for Postgres JSONB, JSON and similar types for Oracle, MySql (and shortly SQL Server).
</p>

<h3>DB ARRAY</h3>
<p>
  Ebean includes mapping support for Postgres ARRAY type.
</p>

<h3>@SoftDelete</h3>
<p>
  Ebean includes support for <a href="/docs/features/softdelete"><code>@SoftDelete</code></a> with associated
    delete permanent, cascading behavior and query support.
</p>

<h3>@Draftable</h3>
<p>
  Ebean includes support for <a href="/docs/features/draftable"><code>@Draftable</code></a> which provides
  "live" and "editing" capability with <code>publish()</code> and <code>restore()</code> function.
</p>
